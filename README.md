### Goldencm's ubuntu init.sh
This build script has only been tested so far on WSL2 and may
or may not be compatible with another linux distro

### Requirements

# Warning
This script by default will attempt to install a neovim config (mine by
default) in the /etc/xdg/nvim directory. This will install the neovim config
system wide. If that is your desired behavior then your neovim config requires
a sysinit.vim initialization file

### Installed Apps

1. Rustup
2. Neovim
3. Gcc
4. Github Cli (for git authentication)
